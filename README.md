# tinycavestory
Little demo of platforming and sprite batching via [tinyheaders](https://github.com/RandyGaul/tinyheaders) and Cave Story art. Made to demonstrate [tinyheaders](https://github.com/RandyGaul/tinyheaders) and provide a good example reference of use cases. The demo features a silly platforming. Notice there are some problems with the character controller! Namely the character will slowly slide down slopes on his own, and can launch himself into the air simply by pressing a or d and running over bumps. Typically these problems are non-trivial to solve, and require special game-specific code to handle them.

Press a, d, 1, or space keys to do things in the demo.
